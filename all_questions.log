2025-08-20T05:39:34.687142+00:00 | Q: what's geofence? | A: The Geofence removes the start and end points if they fall within the geofenced area for when someone else is viewing the run in the community feed. However for the territory game, we donâ€™t remove the geofence as think of the example where you do multiple runs that start at that geofenced area, if you look at the map then there will be an empty circle of space where the geofence is compared to it just showing a larger area of captured territories and therefore revealing where the user has put a geofence. | Status: answered
