Make sure you have installed the latest update of INTVL from the app store if you cant see this feature."}, {"type": "faq", "question": "How does Terra work? What is Terra?", "answer": "The aim of Terra is to capture as much territory as possible.

In Terra the start and end points of a run aren\u2019t shown which helps with privacy as well. If you are concerned with what territories get shown, you can make your Terra profile anonymous."}, {"type": "faq", "question": "My territory was taken but I cant see it on the map ?", "answer": "If you cant see the taken territory on the map it means the user who stole your territory either deleted their account or deleted that run so it isn\u2019t visible anymore."}, {"type": "faq", "question": "Muscle activation exercises", "answer": "Activation exercises are crucial for runners to engage key muscle groups, enhance performance, and prevent injury by preparing the body for the demands of running.
